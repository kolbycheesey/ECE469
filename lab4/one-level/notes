implementation

MemoryModuleInit()
    mark os memory as taken for the free map
        mark pages up to lastosaddress as 1 and rest as 0

MemoryTranslateUserToSystem(PCB *pcb, uint32 addr)
    find the page number by finding virtual page address >> MEM_L1FIELD_FIRST_NUM_BIT_NUM
    index pcbs page table, and check if the valid bit is set, if not invoke a page fault, otherwise begin translation
    translation:
        or the offset with the corresponding page table entry.

MemorySetupPte(uint32 page)

Questions to ask in OH tmrw:
Accessing 0x10d4 causes a page fault (seg fault), instruction memory probably not being mapped correctly to physical memory
Go test the test program first



having issues getting this working on my machine getting this error think its another bin file issue

Is the hello world program called 100 times for test case 5 or is the print statement called in a loop 100 times?

Program is called 100 times
