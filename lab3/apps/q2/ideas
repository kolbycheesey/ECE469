Reactions:
1. S2 -> S + S
2. 4 CO -> 2 O2 + 2 C2
3. S + 2 O2 -> SO4

Args: 
1. # of S2
2. # of CO

* Precalculate the number of reactions per reaction type

* Consumers = reactions
* Producers = generators

Producers will only send using mailboxes
Consumers will receive messages, and check to see if the criteria is met for that reaction, before sending messages again.

note: generators for C2 and SO4 are not needed.

numprocs = S2 + 2 * S2 + CO / 4 + CO / 4 + min(2 * S2, CO / 4)
