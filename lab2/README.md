# Lab 2

This lab demonstrates the implementation and usage of process synchronization techniques such as locks, semaphores, and condition variables.

##
1. Q1 is located in the folder q1.
2. For Q2. Compile the OS by typing ```make``` in the os directory. And then compile the product/consumer program by typing ```make``` in apps/q2. Then run the program by typing ```make run```
3. Code for q3 is in os/synch.c 
4. This question is the same as question 2 except it is implemented with condition variables. Compile the OS by typing ```make``` in the os directory. And then compile the product/consumer program by typing ```make``` in apps/q4. Then run the program by typing ```make run```
5. For Q5. Make sure the os is compiled, and then run ```make``` in apps/q5. Then run the program by typing ```make run```
